Inspired by the great book <i>Getting Things Done</i> by David Allan. This is a program I wrote because I badly needed it in order to organize my own time. I failed to find anything, on any platform, that satisfied my requirements:

* Free
* Preferably Open Source
* Designed after the principles in "Getting Things Done"
* Safe; no unnecessary app privileges, no enforced integration with Google (or any other) services in order to work.
* Fast and efficient to work with
* Safeguards against losing data by accidents in stressful environments (for example by cancelling a half edited task by hitting the Android back button).

These requirements became my blueprint when I built VikingGTD. VikingGTD is free of eye candy and animations â€“ but in stead very fast and responsive, also when the number of tasks grows during real use by busy people. (The database on my device has more than 8000 actions).

VikingGTD implements what I believe is the most essential part of David Allens <i>Getting Things done</i> system: To be able to put all the stuff in your life into a system (lists) you can trust 100%.

It's not a full blown GTD application - a lot of people (me included) are not ready to jump into that in one step. This application is for people who has grown out of the simple "to do apps" and "task managers" and need something a little better.


<b>Features:</b>

* Any number of actions in one of any number of lists.</li>
* Each action can be configured with when, where, how and at what priority. These parameters can then be used to easily sort trough and re-organize the actions.
* Search in lists and actions.
* Fast access to main functions and frequently used features
* Easy to schedule an action to any time, date, week, month, or year.
* Easy and fast to reschedule one or more actions.
* Export to / import from xml on the sdcard for backup and move to other devices. (I use Nextcloud for backing up my app data).
* Flexible automatic repeat of completed actions for reoccurring tasks (from "Feed the cat" the next day to "years into the future).
