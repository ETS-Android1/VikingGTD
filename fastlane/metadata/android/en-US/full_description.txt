Inspired by the great book <i>Getting Things Done</i> by David Allan. This is a program I wrote because I badly needed it in order to organize my own time. I failed to find anything, on any platform, that satisfied my requirements:

* Free
* Preferably Open Source
* Designed after the principles in "Getting Things Done"
* Safe; no unnecessary app privileges, no enforced integration with Google (or any other) services in order to work.
* Fast and efficient to work with
* Safeguards against losing data by accidents in stressful environments (for example by cancelling a half edited task by hitting the Android back button).
* Professionally designed and implemented (I'm just too tired with amateurish implemented "apps").

These requirements became my blueprint when I built VikingGTD. VikingGTD is free of eye candy and animations â€“ but in stead very fast and responsive, also when the number of tasks grows during real use by busy people.

<b>Features:</b>

* Any number of actions in one of any number of lists.</li>
* Each action can be configured with when, where, how and at what priority. These parameters can then be used to easily sort trough and re-organize the actions.
* Search in lists and actions.
* Fast access to main functions and frequently used features
* Easy to schedule an action to any time, date, week, month, or year.
* Easy and fast to reschedule one or more actions.
* No built in limitations, no nagging about money, ***NO ADS***
* No phone home, sneaking in private data or other misbehaviour.
* Import data from the TaskList app if you already use that to organize your life
* Export to / import from xml on the sdcard for backup and move to other devices.
* Flexible automatic repeat of completed actions for reoccurring tasks
